                    <p class="cutoff-text">This fish tank has a lobster and you're welcome. The restaurant, Fresh Salt, is one of the most prized in Miami Beach's iconic South Beach neighborhood. It even won the James Beard award for "Best New Restaurant," according to Eater. The lobsters are a perfect place to catch up with friends over some small plates and drinks, or just have a seat to watch the fish swim around their new home. The tank will be open to diners starting in November.<br><br> A new seafood restaurant has opened in Little Italy. The owners wanted to offer their customers the fresh, local fish that they’ve been fishing for years, but they found it difficult to get the lobsters into a tank before they died. After many hours of research and testing, they developed this new aquarium that keeps lobsters alive—and tastes better than ever!</p>

                    <p class="cutoff-text">To prepare a meal, take the following steps: Shop for ingredients and plan your menu. Grow your own herbs or buy them at a farmers market, if possible. Cook your foods as follows: meats and fish should be seared quickly on high heat to give them color and flavor; pasta should be boiled in plenty of water until al dente, then drained; root vegetables like carrots should be stirred in plenty of butter or olive oil while they are still hot so they soak up the butter.<br><br> Choose the right ingredients. Always use fresh ingredients for best results. Preparing your meal in a way that allows for each ingredient to contribute its natural flavors is how to create great meals. Seasoning generously, especially at the beginning of cooking, brings out the full flavor.</p>

                    <p class="cutoff-text">The Carolina Reaper is currently the hottest pepper in the world. It's been measured at more than 2 million Scoville units, making it about 400 times hotter than a jalapeño. It was created in South Carolina by Ed Currie, who discovered it when a crossbreeding error gave him a uniquely potent pepper.<br><br> At our restaurant we are constantly trying to find ways to make our menu items be more appealing to the customers. One of the techniques that we use to make sure our customers continue coming back for more is by adding hot peppers to our dishes. The most recent peppers to come in are a little on the spicy side, but you will get used to them quickly. Come try us out today and eat some great food that has new peppers in it!</p>
